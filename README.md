# K_RNN_MSCS_634_Lab_2

## Purpose
This lab explores the implementation and evaluation of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model for a specific machine learning task, as part of the MSCS 634 course requirements.

## Key Insights from Accuracy Trends and Observations
- The accuracy trends observed during the experiments provided valuable insights into the performance characteristics of RNNs.
- Patterns in the accuracy graphs helped identify overfitting, underfitting, and the impact of different hyperparameters.
- Iterative adjustments led to incremental improvements and a better understanding of how sequence data is handled by RNN architectures.

## Challenges and Decisions
- Selecting the right architecture and tuning hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs required careful experimentation.
- Managing vanishing gradients and model convergence were notable challenges.
- Decisions around data preprocessing and model selection were driven by both accuracy metrics and the observed trends during training and validation.
